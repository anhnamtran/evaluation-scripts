# Evaluation Scripts
Each directory contains Java scripts, brief usage discussions, and associated
files that I made in order to collect data automatically on performance for
different data structures and algorithms for each project in a CSE course at the
University of Washington. 

All the scripts were developed and documented by me during the course. The
scripts were refactored and uploaded after the fact, mainly for readability, and
removal of any revealing detail about the course material.
